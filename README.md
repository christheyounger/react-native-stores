# React native stores app

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/darkbluesun/react-native-stores.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/darkbluesun/react-native-stores) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/darkbluesun/react-native-stores/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/darkbluesun/react-native-stores)

A sample react native app I created to learn the framework.

Consumes data from https://github.com/darkbluesun/rest-hierarchical

Displays a hierarchical list of stores.

You can press on a store name to load more info.

You can modify a store's name, and delete the store.

## Installation.

I'd recommend using [Expo](https://expo.io/) to try this out.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then, to fire it up, just run (in the project dir):

```
npm i
npm start
```

Tests:

```
npm test

```

optionally add `--collectCoverage` to show code coverage stats.
